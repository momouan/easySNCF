## Project's description

This project deals primarily with train stations in France, giving details and insights about each one of them.<br/>
We therefore in a home page display two tables, train stations ranked by affluence in a first table, 
while the second ranks train stations based on a cleanliness index.</br>
We, in the page named "Gares" have implemented a search engine. The user can type in the name of the 
region, department, city or even the train station and get results in list along with corresponding positions on a map. <br/>
When a result is clicked, we then redirect to a page of details about the corresponding train station.<br/>
Details like waiting services in the station, the precentage of returned items and the cleanliness index are given and visualized
using Pie charts and Column charts.
